                The first method form_enctype sets the form content type. This must be
                set when your form deals with file uploads. Our form doesnâ€™t have any
                use for this method but its always good practice to use this on all
                forms in the event that you may add file uploads in the future.
                Debugging a form that handles file uploads that has no content
                type set can be a real head scratcher!

                Its always a safe bet to use the form_rest method at the end of the
                form to render any fields you may have forgotten, including hidden
                fields and the Symfony2 Form CSRF token.
